# SE4450-project-code
 
## Preprocessing
- Contains the code which will organize input data into pairs and then crop and translate these images to create more training data.

## GUI
- Contains the code which will form the user interface, allowing for uploading of data, interfacing with MATLAB (if necassary), and easily viewing strain imaging.

## Machine Learning
- Contains references to methods used and research about potential algorithims for image scanning. Further has information about programming the GPU in order to train the future algorithims.
